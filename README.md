## 🎯 Key Topics Covered

- **Database Design**: Scalability, reliability, and maintainability principles
- **Storage Engines**: LSM Trees, B+ Trees, and indexing strategies
- **Data Processing**: OLTP vs OLAP, data warehousing
- **Data Encoding**: Serialization formats and schema evolution
- **Replication**: Single-leader, multi-leader, and leaderless approaches
- **Consistency**: Replication lag, quorum consensus, and consistency models
- **Partitioning**: Sharding strategies and consistent hashing
- **Transactions**: ACID properties, isolation levels, and concurrency control
- **Anomalies**: Lost updates, write skew, and serializability challenges

## 📖 Learning Path

This material is organized sequentially by day, with each day building upon the previous concepts:

1. **Foundation**: Start with database fundamentals and storage engines (Day 1)
2. **Data Management**: Learn about data processing and communication patterns (Day 2)
3. **Distribution**: Understand replication and partitioning strategies (Day 3)
4. **Consistency**: Master transactions and isolation guarantees (Day 4)

## 🚀 Usage

Navigate through each day's folder to explore the chapters in order. Each chapter is a standalone markdown file with detailed explanations and concepts.
